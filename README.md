# Arbitrage Trading 
## Motivation
Think about what you really want in life.
Do you want to wake up every day worrying about your personal finance?
Living with a person I hate dreadfully?
Not having a single passionate person to talk to?
Always living under standards set by other people?
Where does that even lead to?
NO WHERE!!!

So you are going to figure it out.
It's going to be a long journey but I know you will figure it out.
You might have to struggle alot.
But you know it's worth it
Every attempt you've failed will all make sense and guide you. 

DO NOT EVER GIVE UP.
